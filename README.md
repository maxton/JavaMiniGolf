# JavaMiniGolf
Simple minigolf game written by me in 2014.

I wrote this game out of boredom and as an effort to help my friends with their own programming woes.

Holes are stored as simple text files with the coordinates of the vertices of green boundaries laid out in "x y" format, line by line.

I hereby release this program to the public domain.
